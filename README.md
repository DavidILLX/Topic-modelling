# Topic Modeling & Classification for Unstructured Text with KNIME
This repository contains a topic modeling and classification project focusing on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and machine learning techniques. The project explores topic extraction, topic labeling, and evaluation metrics using various approaches, including KNIME and data-driven techniques.

## Overview  
With the rise of unstructured text data, topic modeling plays a crucial role in information retrieval, document classification, and knowledge discovery. This project applies LDA, semantic coherence evaluation, and clustering to analyze and classify topics within text datasets such as tweets, articles, and research papers.

## Features
* Text Preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, lemmatization)
* Topic Detection & Classification (LDA, clustering)
* Topic Labeling (manual and algorithmic approaches)
* Evaluation Metrics (coherence score, semantic coherence)
* Visualization (word clouds, topic distributions)
* Integration with KNIME (for automated workflows)

## Evaluation Metrics
To assess the quality of detected topics, the following metrics are used:
* Coherence Score: Measures topic interpretability
* Semantic Coherence: Ensures meaningful word associations
* Topic Distributions: Checks topic-document alignment
* Classification Accuracy: If supervised labels are available
